### Containers

All the containers that are provided for this CI can be found here:

### The compiler

While our containers do run the TravisCI configuration file. They only run the
build "script" instructions. It's up to us to:

* Build all the permutations.
* Links Docker containers so we have "services".

### Vagrant

Vagrant is very handy. If you do not run Docker natively the following VM will
provide a method for debugging and building and executing of containers locally.

Install Vagrant (1.6.x):

```
http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
```

Spin up a VM with Docker with the following command:

```
vagrant up
```

### Packer

Packer is an amazing tool for building prepackaged images. Currently we are only building an AWS image.
A Vagrant image is also on the roadmap.

#### Installation

http://www.packer.io/docs/installation.html

#### Usage

Images can be built via the following commands:

```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY='Super secret access key'
$ export AWS_SECRET_KEY='Super secret secret key'
$ packer build packer/ubuntu/amazon.json
```
